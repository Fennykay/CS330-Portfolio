# 1. How do I approach designing software? #
When Beginning a project, I first begin with modularizing all of the requirements so as to get a high level view of my path forward. Just diving into work right away is sure to find yourself in the weeds and trying to make sense of everything while neck deep in it. Stepping back allows you to create a path towards the finish. Once everything is broken down, you can then begin assigning them difficulty and load levels, this is key to determining how much time should be spent on each aspect, or moreso the ratio of time each should get. After everything has been given it's designation, you can then begin working based on your real life schedule.

# 2. How do I approach developing programs? #
Once work as actually gone underway, it is about getting a serviceable proof of concept up as quickly as possible. In the context of this project, there were several stages where the entire goal was to just get something on the screen. Such as implementing the camera movement, we already had a camera view and so the first goal was to allow for my 'W' key to move the camera forward. After this is completed, we know items are working and we know how to do it, we then begin implementing this for the rest of the needed functionality. This cycles over and over until we get to the next checkpoint or milestone.

# 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? #
Computer Science is going to help me reach my goal of leading a successful life that can sustain itself. I look forward to creating/working on a project that will equip real people with something that makes their lives easier, or more enjoyable. I would like to leave my stamp on the world.
